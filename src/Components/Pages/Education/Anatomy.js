                                    All the diamonds are unique in their own way but share the same basic structure. 
                                    The structural features of a diamond determine its brilliance, proportions, and 
                                    scintillation. Each part of its basic structure has a particular name. Understanding 
                                    how these parts contribute to the diamond as a whole help one to choose the perfect 
                                    stone. The basic structure of a diamond consists of eight main parts namely table, 
                                    diameter, crown, girdle, pavilion, depth, crown, and culet. Hereâ€™s a brief 
                                    description of each part.
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                            Diameter: If the width of the polished stone is measured from end-to-end, 
                            the diameter of the diamond is obtained.<br/>
                            Table: The table is the largest polished surface on the top of the diamond.<br/>
                            Crown: It is the top part of a diamond that extends from the table to the girdle.<br/>
                            Girdle: Girdle is the part of the diamond where the crown and pavilion of the diamond 
                            meet.<br/>
                            Culet: Culet is the small and pointed facet at the bottom of the diamond.<br/>
                            Pavilion: The bottom part of the diamond that extends from the girdle to the culet.<br/>
                            It is important to understand the anatomy of solitaire diamonds before choosing the right 
                            one to appreciate the intricacies of the diamond.
